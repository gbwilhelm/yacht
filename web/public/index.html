    <h1><span class=underline>Welcome to Project Yacht</span></h1>
    <p>This page serves as a technical explanation for this project and its evolution.</p>
    <h2>Java Version</h2>
    <p>This project began as a single-file Java program that ran on the command line.
       When ran, the program prompted the user to either play Yacht or run a test script.
       The Yacht game was fully functional, and input and output were done in the terminal.
       <br><br>This version had a feature that allowed multiple players to play at a time.
       In each round, each player performed their three rolls and scored in sequence.
       At the end of the game, the player with the highest score was declared the winner.
       This multiplayer functionality was removed in subsequent versions, as it conflicted with database interactions.
       <br><br>This version is available in the GitHub repository as prog/Yacht.java.
    </p>
    <h2>Java AWS Version</h2>
    <p>The next stage of this project was adding AWS DynamoDB functionality to save a player's final score.
       As this project needed build dependencies to run, it was created in Eclipse using the AWS Java SDK.
       <br><br>Multiplayer functionality was removed, but the basic game structure remained the same.
       After finishing a game, the player had the option of saving the game data to the database.
       The player could enter a username and game title, then those fields were sent to the database with the game's scorecard.
       <br><br>The source code, but not the build files, for this version is available in the GitHub repository as prog/Yacht_AWS.java.
    </p>
    <h2>JavaScript Vue Version</h2>
    <p>While the Java versions were fully functional, I wanted to port them to a public web server.
       To start this process, I had to recreate the program from scratch using JavaSctipt, Vue, HTML, and CSS.
       <br><br>Before working on the JavaScript version, I created a test application with basic Vue functionality by following the official Vue documentation.
       This practice application has since been removed from the repository, but can be viewed in earlier commits.
       <br><br>This version turned the Java version into an interactive front-end Vue application, with I/O operations done with buttons and links.
       The architecture of this version was a single Vue application that used a number of child components to perform both I/O operations and game logic.
       <br><br>Since this version was entirely front-end, there was no database interaction, and there is not a finalized version in the repository.
    </p>
    <h2>Node Local Version</h2>
    <p>Once the game logic for the front-end version was complete, it was time to begin the back-end construction.
       The back-end is build on a simple Node server, installed using Yarn, that runs a REST API using Express.
       This is where the AWS JavaScript SDK is used to allow DynamoDB functionality for the project.
       <br><br>The front-end was modified to send API requests to the back end and then waited for a response.
       The back-end transformed the requests into DynamoDB insert and query requests, then forwarded the responses back to the front-end.
       Unique to this version is the public leaderboard, which simply fetches and displays the top ten scores from the database.
       <br><br>This version is found on the Github repository under the web/ directory.
    </p>
    <h2>AWS Architecture</h2>
    <p>Since the Java AWS version, I began to provision and utilize AWS services.
       <br><br>I initially created a DynamoDB table using the SDK; however, the table configuration has changed many times since the initial creation.
       The table's current key configuration is a single primary key, which is an MD5 hash of the object containing the data fields.
       This ensures each entry is unique, as the only time a key would match is if all data fields also match.
       I then created a Global Secondary Index, which uses a version string as the primary key and the game's score as the sort key.
       To fetch the top 10 scores, I query the GSI with an item limit of 10, which returns presorted.
       <br><br>I also hooked a Lambda function to my DynamoDB table stream, and it listens for INSERT operations.
       I created an SNS topic and added my email as a subscriber; I also created a Resource Group for all the services I provisioned for this project.
       The lambda function grabs some basic information from the DynamoDB INSERT event, then publishes the formatted message to the SNS topic.
       As such, I receive an email whenever anyone saves their game to my database.
       The Lambda function source code has been included in the GitHub repository as prog/Lambda_Function.py.
       <br><br>The server currently runs on an EC2 t2.micro instance running Ubuntu 20.
       Since I expect little load on my server, it is not using an Auto Scaling Group or Load Balancer.
       My server uses a modified version of the github source code, where local file paths have been changed to absolute file paths.
       I run my server through Forever as a cron job, which ensures uptime after a crash or system reboot.
       As with my Lambda function, I enable permissions via IAM Roles with AWS Managed Policies.
